# Q.1>- what is Variable
# Ans - Variable simply bare nothing but value holders ,
# Again variable will be forming as the building block in multiple things while programming in python.....

# Rule of Variable --
# Rule 1st -- No Space allow while declaring the variables..
# Rule 2nd -- Variable Should not start with Numbes...
#Rule 3rd -- Variable should not Contain Special Characters like - @,#,$,%,&,*....

#Rule No 1 Example --
# My Name='krishna'     <-- No Space allow While Declaring the variable..
# print(My Name)        <-- We will get Error Message as invalid Syantax with Line Number...

# Rule No 2 Example --
# 1Name="krishna"       <-- Variable Should not start with Numbes...
# print(1Name)          <-- We will get Error Message as invalid Syantax with Line Number...

#Rule No 3 Example --
# @Name='krishna'       <-- Variable should not Contain Special Characters like - @,#,$,%,&,*....
# print(@Name)          <-- We will get Error Message as invalid Syantax with Line Number...
